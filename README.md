# [`video-store` camera](https://app.viam.com/module/viam/video-store)

The `video-store` module brings security camera functionality to your smart machine! The module consumes a source [Camera](https://docs.viam.com/components/camera/) and saves the output as video files on disk. You can then upload video slices to the cloud using the [save](#save) command, or request the video bytes directly using the [fetch](#fetch) command.

Navigate to the [**CONFIGURE** tab](https://docs.viam.com/configure/) of your [machine](https://docs.viam.com/fleet/machines/) in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/).
[Add camera / video-store to your machine](https://docs.viam.com/configure/#components).

## Requirements

### Configure a Data Manager Service

Make sure to configure a [Data Manager Service](https://docs.viam.com/services/data/cloud-sync/) to upload video files to the cloud when saving video slices.

Navigate to the [**CONFIGURE** tab](https://docs.viam.com/configure/) of your [machine](https://docs.viam.com/fleet/machines/) in [the Viam app](https://app.viam.com/). [Add data-management to your machine](https://docs.viam.com/configure/#services).

> [!NOTE]
> The `additional_sync_paths` attribute must include the custom path specified in the `upload_path` attribute of the `video-store` component if it is not under `~/.viam/capture`.

```json
    {
      "name": <data_manager_service_name>,
      "namespace": "rdk",
      "type": "data_manager",
      "attributes": {
        "tags": [],
        "additional_sync_paths": [
          <custom_path_to_upload_video_files>
        ],
        "capture_disabled": true,
        "sync_interval_mins": <sync_interval_minutes>,
        "capture_dir": ""
      }
    }
```

## Configure your `video-store` component

Video store requires a [Data Manager](https://docs.viam.com/data-ai/capture-data/capture-sync/#configure-the-data-management-service-for-your-machine) to be configured on you machine before it can be used.
Use the "depends_on" dropdown to add a dependency on the datamanger configured on your machine. 


Copy and paste the following attributes into your JSON configuration:
```json
{
  "camera": "<source-camera-name>",
  "sync": "<data-manager-service-name>",
  "storage": {
    "size_gb": <int>
  }
}
```



Additionally, make sure to add your configured data manager service to the `depends_on` array of your `video-store` component.

### Example Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "video-store",
  "namespace": "rdk",
  "type": "camera",
  "model": "viam:video:storage",
  "attributes": {
    "camera": "wc-cam",
    "sync": "data-manager",
    "storage": {
      "size_gb": 50
    }

  ]
}
```

### DoCommand API

#### From/To

The `From` and `To` timestamps are used to specify the start and end times for video clips. These timestamps must be provided in a specific datetime format to ensure proper parsing and formatting.

##### Datetime Format

The datetime format used is:

- Local Time: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`
- UTC Time: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SSZ`

Where:
- `YYYY`: Year (e.g., 2023)
- `MM`: Month (e.g., 01 for January)
- `DD`: Day (e.g., 15)
- `HH`: Hour in 24-hour format (e.g., 14 for 2 PM)
- `MM`: Minutes (e.g., 30)
- `SS`: Seconds (e.g., 45)
- `Z`: Optional suffix indicating the time is in UTC.

##### Datetime Example

- `2024-01-15_14-30-45` represents January 15, 2024, at 2:30:45 PM **local time**.
- `2024-01-15_14-30-45Z` represents January 15, 2024, at 2:30:45 PM **UTC**.

#### `Save`

The save command retreives video from local storage, concatenates and trims underlying storage segments based on time range, and uploads the clip to the cloud.

| Attribute   | Type                | Required/Optional | Description                      |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `command`   | string              | required          | Command to be executed.          |
| `from`      | timestamp           | required          | Start timestamp.                 |
| `to`        | timestamp           | required          | End timestamp.                   |
| `metadata`  | string              | optional          | Arbitrary metadata string.       |
| `async`     | boolean             | optional          | Whether the operation is async.  |

##### Save Request
```json
{
  "command": "save",
  "from": <start_timestamp>,
  "to": <end_timestamp>,
  "metadata": <arbitrary_metadata_string>
}
```

##### Save Response
```json
{
  "command": "save",
  "filename": <filename_to_be_uploaded>
}
```

##### Async Save Request

The async save command performs the same operation as the save command, but does not wait for the operation to complete. Use this command when you want to save video slices that include the current in-progress video storage segment. It will wait for the current segment to finish recording before saving the video slice.

> [!NOTE]
> The async save command does not support future timestamps. The `from` timestamp must be in the past.
> The `to` timestamp must be the current time or in the past.

```json
{
  "command": "save",
  "from": <start_timestamp>,
  "to": <end_timestamp>,
  "metadata": <arbitrary_metadata_string>,
  "async": true
}
```

##### Async Save Response
```json
{
  "command": "save",
  "filename": <filename_to_be_uploaded>,
  "status": "async"
}
```

#### `Fetch`

The fetch command retrieves video from local storage, and sends the bytes directly back to the client.

| Attribute | Type       | Required/Optional | Description          |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `command` | string     | required          | Command to be executed. |
| `from`    | timestamp  | required          | Start timestamp.     |
| `to`      | timestamp  | required          | End timestamp.       |

##### Fetch Request
```json
{
  "command": "fetch",
  "from": <start_timestamp>,
  "to": <end_timestamp>
}
```

##### Fetch Response
```json
{
  "command": "fetch",
  "video": <video_bytes>
}
```

### `Get Storage State`

The `get-storage-state` command retrieves the current state of video storage, including available video time ranges and disk usage information.

| Attribute | Type       | Required/Optional | Description          |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| `command` | string     | required          | The command to be executed. Value must be "get-storage-state". |

#### Get Storage State Request
```json
{
  "command": "get-storage-state"
}
```

#### Get Storage State Response

The response includes a list of `stored_video` time ranges and `disk_usage` statistics.

```json
{
  "command": "get-storage-state",
  "stored_video": [
    {
      "from": "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SSZ",
      "to": "YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SSZ"
    },
    // ... more ranges
  ],
  "disk_usage": {
    "storage_path": "/path/to/your/storage/directory",
    "storage_used_gb": 99.98,
    "storage_limit_gb": 100,
    "device_storage_remaining_gb": 697.21
  }
}
```

**Response Fields:**

-   `stored_video`: An array of objects, where each object represents a contiguous block of recorded video.
    -   `from`: The start UTC timestamp of the video block.
    -   `to`: The end UTC timestamp of the video block.
-   `disk_usage`:
    -   `storage_path`: The configured path where video segments are stored.
    -   `storage_used_gb`: The amount of disk space (in GB) currently used by the video store in its `storage_path`.
    -   `storage_limit_gb`: The configured maximum disk space (in GB) allocated for the video store.
    -   `device_storage_remaining_gb`: The remaining free disk space (in GB) on the underlying storage device where `storage_path` is located.

#### Example Get Storage State Response

```json
{
  "command": "get-storage-state",
  "stored_video": [
    {
      "to": "2025-05-18_05-59-58Z",
      "from": "2025-05-17_20-23-08Z"
    },
    {
      "from": "2025-05-18_06-00-35Z",
      "to": "2025-05-19_13-56-55Z"
    },
    {
      "from": "2025-05-19_13-57-13Z",
      "to": "2025-05-19_13-58-18Z"
    }
    // ... additional video ranges truncated for brevity
  ],
  "disk_usage": {
    "storage_path": "/root/.viam/video-storage/video_camera-XYZ",
    "storage_used_gb": 99.98937438707799,
    "storage_limit_gb": 100,
    "device_storage_remaining_gb": 697.2153244018555
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Swapping the `storage_path` config attribute will not delete any data, it will simply cause video store to start persisting video data to the new path and preserve
the old `storage_path` directory with the old videos and the old database, and save new videos in the new path.
